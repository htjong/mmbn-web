# Battle Canvas 600 Centered Scale

Raise the battle canvas height to `600`, scale the battle scene up by `20%` while preserving aspect ratio, and center the scaled scene inside the canvas.

## Chosen Direction: Centered Power-Up
**Concept:** Increase battle canvas height to 600 and scale the battle scene uniformly to 1.2x. Preserve aspect ratio with no independent axis stretch and keep the scene centered in the expanded canvas. This keeps composition familiar while making combat read larger.
**Key Mechanic:** Fixed 20% uniform zoom with strict aspect-ratio preservation and centered framing in a 600px canvas.
**What It Adds:** Bigger action readability with stable, distortion-free presentation.
