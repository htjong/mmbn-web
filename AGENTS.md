## Repository Safety Boundaries
- NEVER perform actions outside of this repository without prompting the user first and receiving explicit confirmation.
- NEVER read any `.env` file or any variation of `.env` files (including but not limited to `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*`, `*.env`, and similar patterns).
- IGNORE the `.claude/` and `.archive/` folders unless specifically instructed by the user to access them.
